# Shamrock
## The solution to improve your gameplay
### We allow our users to modify the game environment, and lending a hand for aiming.
In such cases you can use:
- Environment Editor (Disable Post Processing Effects, materials, textures, etc)
- Aim Assist (Fully customizable)
And more!

## Decent for closet cheating
You can easily closet cheat using Shamrock by choosing the correct settings which we give you context so you can understand what the features do, for example you can turn a simple Aimbot into Aim Assist by changing sensitivity **(or just use the AA in our Ghost tab eh?)**

It's even possible to simulate professional movement using this script while hiding the fact you are using Shamrock

## Perfect visuals
In Shamrock, you can get perfect visuals **just** by simply modifying our settings in Render that are so simple even a 8 year old child can do it.

We allow you to see if the player was hit and for how much damage (depending on the game Shamrock is injected in)

## Streamable (depends on your executor)
Shamrock is streamable if your executor hides Drawing libraries (just don't toggle the GUI), which lets you hide the fact you are cheating **while recording**.

You can do that by modifying your configs to look legit (rely on the **Ghost** tab for this), in which the features are rich for:
- User experience & satisfaction
- Legit looking gameplay
- Good gamesense (if you even have 1)

## Easy modifications
### You can modify Shamrock for proper and enhanced experience!
Simply inject Shamrock
